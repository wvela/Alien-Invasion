# Alien-Invasion
Final project for Mobile App Development


This repo contains my final project from Mobile App Development.

This is an Alien invasion inspired mobile app game. For gameplay instructions and know issues check "Everything you need to know about Alien Invaders.docx".


TO-DO:
  1. Implement enemy collision so that enemy flight paths become more unpredictable when they bounce off each other. 
  2. Fix enemy spawn. (Have enemies spawn off screen and fly in)
  3. Fix enemies getting stuck on the bottom of the screen
  4. Implement more levels/enemy types/power ups
  5. Create a menu and pause screen
